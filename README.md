# Data Pagination and Filtering

My second JavaScript project where I have information for 42 students, including name, email, and picture that need to be displayed 9 students per page. I also needed to add pagination buttons that the user can click to display different pages of students.

My application needed to work with a list of any number of students, not just with the supplied array of 42 students. This project required the code be written in plain JavaScript.

Screenshots of the completed projects are below.
